targets.csv:

Each row corresponds to a 15-minute vehicle count for a specific traffic sensor 
(StationId). StartTime indicates the actual start time of the 15-minute 
aggregation period, i.e. "2020-04-01 00:00:00" includes all vehicle counts from 
"00:00:00" until "00:15:00". The vehicle counts are given by NumberOfVehicles. 
An odd numbered sensor (e.g. 101) indicates city in-bound traffic, while even 
numbered sensor (e.g. 102) indicates out-bound traffic.

Some more specific information about this data:

* The data corresponds to a specific road segment on Klarastrandsleden in 
Stockholm
* The data collection period is from 2020-04-01 00:00:00 until 2020-09-30 
23:45:00
* StationId=101 covers one lane
* StationId=102 covers two lanes (one lane is turning-off towards Solna)
* The speed limit on the road is 70 km/hr
* The distance between traffic sensor and 4G mast is ~ 450m

NOTES:

* You should add StationId 101 and 102 and look at total number of vehicles
* There may be missing values in the dataset

features.csv:

Each row corresponds to a 15-min path loss distribution for a specific cell 
(CellId). There are four cells - two on 1800MHz carrier frequency (Band), one 
on 800MHz, and one on 2600MHz. StartTime indicates the actual start time of a 
15-minute aggregation period, i.e. "2020-08-01 00:00:00" includes all path loss 
distribution values from "00:00:00" until "00:15:00". Path loss values are in 
decibles (dB) and distributed as follows:

PL_00: PL less than or equals to 50
PL_01: 50 less than PL less than or equals to 55
PL_02: 55 less than PL less than or equals to 60
PL_03: 60 less than PL less than or equals to 65
PL_04: 65 less than PL less than or equals to 70
PL_05: 70 less than PL less than or equals to 75
PL_06: 75 less than PL less than or equals to 80
PL_07: 80 less than PL less than or equals to 85
PL_08: 85 less than PL less than or equals to 90
PL_09: 90 less than PL less than or equals to 95
PL_10: 95 less than PL less than or equals to 100
PL_11: 100 less than PL less than or equals to 105
PL_12: 105 less than PL less than or equals to 110
PL_13: 110 less than PL less than or equals to 115
PL_14: 115 less than PL less than or equals to 120
PL_15: 120 less than PL less than or equals to 125
PL_16: 125 less than PL less than or equals to 130
PL_17: 130 less than PL less than or equals to 135
PL_18: 135 less than PL less than or equals to 140
PL_19: 140 less than PL less than or equals to 145
PL_20: 145 less than PL

The 4G mast is situated ~ 450m from the traffic sensor, and is at a height of 
27m above ground (NOTE: the relative height compared to the traffic sensor may 
be greater since the tower is on top of a building which is on top of a hill).

NOTES:

* Low path loss values are rare, so first PL_* bins are usually zeroes
* Instead of selecting all PL values are features, we could select only those 
bins that correspond to the distance of 450m - to obtain the correct PL bin we 
need to plug-in the distance (450m) into a COST Hata formulae (see References); 
note however that since the formula depends on carrier frequency, we need to 
treat each band separately
* Another alternative is to apply a kernel/convolution operation to all PL 
bins, where the highest probability/weight is put on the PL bin that best 
corresponds to the distance
